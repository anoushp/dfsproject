Drawing on the capability maturity concept combined with the application of expert group techniques, this study develops a novel web-based DfOSH capability maturity model that enables the assessment of the DfOSH capability
of design organisations in the built environment. The model captures 18 DfOSH organisational capability attributes mapped onto five stages of capability maturation
which are further contextualised by the incorporation of maturity level indicator examples in order to enable ease of use of the model. Results of the model evaluation confirm the modelâ€™s usefulness. Design firms could apply the model to self-assess
their capability in order to understand the areas of capability deficiency and strength. Client organisations could also use the model as part of pre-qualification arrangements
in selecting design firms with the needed DfOSH capability.
